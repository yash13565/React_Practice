# React Timer App

# Task Overview

## Your goal is to implement a timer with the following functionalities:
## Clicking the Start button should begin the timer.
## Clicking the Reset button should reset the timer to 00:00:00.
## Clicking the Pause button should stop the timer while allowing it to resume from where it stopped.

# Instructions

## The Timer component is located in the src folder.
## Basic styling has already been providedâ€”you only need to implement the logic.
## If you get stuck, you can refer to the existing logic in the Timer component for guidance, but try to solve it on your own first.

## Good Luck & Happy Coding! ðŸš€
